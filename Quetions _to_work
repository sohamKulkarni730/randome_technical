1. In spark , Data presented in fiels can be read directly into dataframes - > processed and stored into tables and we can do reverse i.e. read and store data into table first and
  then read it into dataframe to perform conversion -> store data back to tables. In any application, both approches can yeild same results  ; What we are not sure is the
  performance of each method and beat usecase for each. 

2.Indexng options - which scheme is better and for what scenarios ?
3.How a query cost can be measured within synapse?

4.Adhoc queries vs Stored proc vs ADF whic is cheaper and how can we optimise it ?

5.Execution plans ... working with them

6. SQL query optimisation
  - it is very impoprtant to consider that other queries will also be running parallel
    to query you are optimising, thus achiving less query time with more computation usage is 
    can be a bad idea

7. optimise the ingestion proess
