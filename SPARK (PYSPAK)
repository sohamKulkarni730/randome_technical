      2. Creating spark scheam in DLL string and in structType in (Python and Java)
      
      3. Coelese is used for performance reasons,Coelese divides an RDD into number of partition of outr choice. if we choose partiion to be one tit will perform like collect()
            . But unlike collect() result will still be an RDD. we can change the number of partitions and hence no of spark node working at a time
      
      4. data skew is a huge problem in big data applications, exmple is when we do a groupBy operations , we eend up having n numberof groups of data 
            an that might occupy only n number of worked instaed of all of the workers in cluster. This makes wor distribution uneven and results in 
            time lag / performance degradation . A way to deal withthis called salting. Salting makes key change into aratificial keys , ie.e ram is replaced with 
            ram1 and ram2 . thus in group by opration those two key are treated as different and number of partition increases-> resulting in better utilisation of whole
            cluster.
            but salting should be used a a last tool to deal with skewing problem as more number of partition will increase work in shuffle stage and networ is goinf to be suffer.
            Anywasys , salting need some testing to be done to know whthere benefits of implementing are outways the implemenion efforts
