--STRING OPERATIONS

-String should start with vovel
       (INSTR(CITY, 'e') = 1)   ### SQL positions are not like array, It start with 1st position (not 0th position)
      -INSTR() function returns the first occurence of a character/string ### CASE INSENSETIVE 
      SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION WHERE 
      (INSTR(CITY, 'a') = 1)

      OR (INSTR(CITY, 'o') = 1)
