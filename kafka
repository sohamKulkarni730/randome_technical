Step 1 start zookeeper server (A server that organises and keep configurations for distributed systems) : (In one command window)
(On wiindows machine: got to bin/windows location if kafka has not been added to path variable . Zookeeper property file is under config directory)
zookeeper-server-start.bat ../../config/zookeeper.properties

(On wiindows machine: got to bin/windows location if kafka has not been added to path variable)
kafka-server-start.bat server.properties


List all the topics created:
(On wiindows machine: got to bin/windows location if kafka has not been added to path variable)
kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeepr localhost:2181


Create topics under kafka: (In other command windows than zookeepr and kafka)
(On wiindows machine: got to bin/windows location if kafka has not been added to path variable)
kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partition 1 -- topic <topicName>

kafka-console-producer.bat --bootstarp-server localhost:9092 --topic <topicName> --from-beginning
